## 🔧 What Needs Work ("Massaging")

The plugin works but likely needs improvements in:

### Potential Issues to Address
1. **Layout & Spacing** - Elements might overlap or be poorly spaced
2. **Visual Design** - Colors, fonts, or styling might need adjustment
3. **Dark/Light Mode** - May need to detect Figma's theme and adjust colors
4. **Arrows/Connectors** - Flow steps might need connecting lines
5. **UI Title** - Change "Flow Diagram Annotator" to "UX Flow Logic" in ui.html (line 50)
6. **Responsive Sizing** - Diagram dimensions might need adjustment

### Specific Customizations Mentioned
- Dark/Light mode detection based on Figma background
- Adjustable font sizes
- Adding arrows between steps
- Better spacing and layout

## 🚀 How to Continue Tomorrow

### To Make Changes:

1. **Navigate to the folder in Terminal:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Figma\ plugin/UX\ Flow\ Logic
   ```

2. **Edit files in VS Code:**
   - Open folder: File → Open Folder → select "UX Flow Logic"
   - Make changes to `code.ts`, `ui.html`, etc.

3. **Recompile after editing `code.ts`:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc code.ts --target ES2017 --lib ES2017
   ```

4. **Reload plugin in Figma:**
   - Plugins → Development → Reload plugin
   - Or: Right-click → Plugins → Development → UX Flow Logic

### Quick Commands Reference:
```bash
# Navigate to plugin folder
cd ~/Documents/Figma\ plugin/UX\ Flow\ Logic

## 🎯 Next Steps for Refinement

### Option 1: Visual Tweaks
Adjust colors, spacing, fonts in `code.ts`:
- Change background colors
- Adjust text sizes
- Modify positioning (x, y coordinates)
- Update spacing between elements

### Option 2: Add Features
- **Dark mode detection**: Read Figma's background color
- **Arrows**: Draw connectors between flow steps
- **UI customization**: Add color/font controls in ui.html
- **Better layout**: Use auto-layout or smarter positioning

### Option 3: Fix Specific Issues
Tell Claude what specifically looks wrong (e.g., "text overlaps", "colors are wrong", "spacing too tight") and get targeted fixes.

## 💡 Tips for Tomorrow

1. **Test the plugin first** - Run it and see what needs fixing
2. **Be specific** - Note exact issues (colors, spacing, missing features)
3. **One change at a time** - Easier to debug if something breaks
4. **Save often** - Use Git or manual backups
