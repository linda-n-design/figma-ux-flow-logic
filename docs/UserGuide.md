## Best Practices

### UX Flow Design Tips

**Do:**
- Start with the happy path (ideal user journey)
- Add edge cases and error states after
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related flows together
- Add annotations for complex logic

**Avoid:**
- Crossing flow lines when possible
- Overcrowding one area
- Using too many colors (stick to 2-3)
- Skipping labels on decision points

### Collaboration Tips
- **Layer naming**: Name your flow diagram layers clearly (e.g., "Login Flow", "Checkout Flow")
- **Frames**: Place each major flow in its own frame for organization
- **Comments**: Use Figma comments to discuss specific decision points with your team
- **Versioning**: Duplicate frames when making major changes to preserve history

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Won't Open
- **Solution**: Refresh Figma (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R) and try again
- Check if plugin is installed under **Resources** → **Plugins**

### Guide Doesn't Appear on Canvas
- **Solution**: Make sure you have edit access to the file
- Zoom out - the guide may be placed outside your current view
- Check if layers are locked

### Can't Find the Plugin
- **Solution**: Search for "UX Flow Logic" in the plugin menu
- Verify you're using Figma Desktop or browser (not FigJam)
